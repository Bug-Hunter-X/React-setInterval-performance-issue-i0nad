# React setInterval Performance Issue
This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React applications related to the usage of `setInterval` with a very short delay.  The provided code uses `setInterval` with a delay of 1 millisecond which is too small to work efficiently.

## Problem
The `setInterval` function in the `MyComponent` is called repeatedly every millisecond, causing continuous state updates.  This results in many unnecessary re-renders.  In high-performance applications or when the component is complex, this can easily lead to performance degradation, browser freezing or even crashes.

## Solution
The ideal solution depends on your application's requirements.  For simple counters, `setTimeout` can be used to update the counter and reschedule the next update.
For more complex interactions, libraries such as `useAnimationFrame` are available to implement this efficiently.
